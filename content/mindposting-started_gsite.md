I have recently been considering having a platform for privately shared 
thoughts, but always being annoyed with twitter or fedi private accounts 
having only one designated "circle", in Google+ nomenclature.

And Google+ is defunct now.

So I decided to set up something that would have proper ACLs. Besides 
Facebook, which is bad&boycotted, and also presents the ACLs to everyone 
included in them, my only option seemed to have some kind of a website.

I considered Joomla with has ACLs, but decided to just use Google Sites 
Classic, inspired by the idea that SharePoint has ACLs.

(It was troublesome to setup Joomla in an ephemeral-serverlessly and 
resilient way… on Heroku. So I gave up on that.)

Note that to create a Google Sites Classic site yourself, you have to 
navigate to sites.google.com/classic

So, contact me mentioning your Google Account email address and i will 
add you to ACLs of my newly created mkfmindposting — 
https://sites.google.com/site/mkfmindposting or https://mind1.mikf.pl — 
so that you see any posts on there.

*Update*: see [here a newer post in which i consider cross-posting to Diaspora](diasp_dot_org_diaspora_account/)
