i posted a thread of some tweets about my learnings about my panic 
attacks triggered by human-body-workings thinking.

A friend asked: <q>what does it… feel like?</q> ( 1:38 AM )

> calmness. nauseous. fear of tripping and falling. "gotta handle 
> vomiting". "maybe i should consider getting more oxygen, maybe low 
> temperature will help". "no, too cold, lets go back; also i might fall 
> over that balcony barrier." adrenaline, very good procedural thinking.

> "hopefully my heart will do fine."

The friend asked: <q>what triggers it?</q> ( 2:09 AM )
