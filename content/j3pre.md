I have just mained an 8GB Samsung Galaxy J3 2016. I run stock on it, and I lack space terribly.

The home button is so cheap that is has to be pressed really hard just to trigger the Home button functionality (which is its only functionality).

It is usable as long as I keep some apps, like Revolut, on another device (my old archive-bloated Nexus 5 running some late Cyanogenmod nightly).
