I have decided to try creating a Diaspora account on a pod (instance) operated by a third party, choosing [diasp.org](https://diasp.org) for no good reason.

My account there is [mkf@diasp.org](https://diasp.org/people/ef8038e035b80138b919047d7b62795e) — https://diasp.org/people/ef8038e035b80138b919047d7b62795e

As I am still hesitant to rely on that pod, unsure whether i could be at risk of losing data there, i am not sure if i will choose to use it [for the purpose for which I am presently using Google Sites](/mindposting-started_gsite/).
Except, do i trust that pod enough for that.

Maybe I will cross-post. That way I wouldn't lose data if something unexpected would happen to the pod.

Either send me your Diaspora handles, or send me your Gmail addresses. I will add you to the respective one of the two.

Please suggest me other ways how can I blog privately with per-post ACLs. I know I could write my own site for that but damn that takes time.

Also, idk how Diaspora handles the comment visibility issue… hopefully I can just disable comments under posts there
