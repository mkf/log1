Today i were doing a homework assignment task (https://kino.vm.wmi.amu.edu.pl/05en.htm) where we got an image and had to remake this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Document Title</title>

    <!-- external CSS link -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/reset.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>

    <div class="page">

My result so far, with some really nasty CSS and general practices, but generally done lazily, although with heavy use of GIMP for analysis:

It felt like a very bad waste of time and a worthless experience.
